<h3>Software Breakthroughs in Probability Management and Seminars in Risk Visualization</h3>

Dear XLSim user,<BR><BR>

The ongoing struggle against the Flaw of Averages has resulted in a new paradigm for modeling risk and uncertainty: Probability Management. As we recently explained in a two-part <a
href="http://www.lionhrtpub.com/orms/orms-2-06/frprobability.html">article in
OR/MS Today,</a> Probability Management allows you to consolidate, audit and broadcast your simulation analysis in unprecedented ways.<BR><BR>

Since we began working on Probability Management in 2005, two technological advances have facilitated its application on desktop computers: First, in 2006, <a href="http://www.solver.com/">Frontline Systems</a> introduced the <a
href="http://www.solver.com/platform/risk-solver-platform.htm">Risk Solver.</a> Its high-performance simulation engine can interactively perform thousands of Monte Carlo trials before your finger leaves the <Enter> key.

More recently, working with Oracle Corp., SAS Institute, Frontline Systems and others, AnalyCorp led the development of the DIST&#153; Distribution String. This new data type encapsulates thousands of Monte Carlo trials in a single cell, reducing the data manipulation required for interactive simulation by orders of magnitude. (You can find DIST-enabled spreadsheet models at <a
href="http://www.probabilitymanagement.org/">ProbabilityManagement.org.</a>)<BR><BR>

Thus we are uniquely positioned to assist organizations with their own adoption of Probability Management-based analysis. In conjunction with the publication of the DIST 1.0 standard at ProbabilityManagement.org, two of our strategic partners, Frontline Systems and SAS Institute, are offering limited time discounts to XLSim users on software that is central to this exciting new type of business modeling.

<h3>$250 Credit on Risk Solver 9.0 for Excel-based Probability Management</h3>

Frontline Systems has just released the latest generation of its Risk Solver technology. As the first commercially available software to support the DIST data type, it truly does for probability what the spreadsheet did for numbers. Risk Solver technology has been key to AnalyCorp's most successful Probability Management applications, and we are already converting our client's models over to the DIST 1.0 standard. Tests indicate that Risk Solver is roughly 2.5 times faster when processing DISTs than our initial implementations.<BR><BR>

Act now to take advantage of Frontline Systems' special offer to XLSim users of a $250 credit towards purchase of Risk Solver. Call Frontline at (888) 831-0333 (U.S. and Canada) or (775) 831 0300) and mention coupon code, XLSIM123108f by December 31st 2008. Converting most XLSim models to run with Risk Solver technology takes little more than a global search and replace. You can download a 15-day trial version of Risk Solver Platform (a superset of Risk Solver) at <a
href="http://www.solver.com/">www.Solver.com.</a>

<h3>$300 discount on JMP&#174; 8. Use it to for Validate Data and Present Results</h3>

The successful application of Probability Management techniques requires validation and visualization of the distributions that drive probabilistic analysis. Here, an existing technology has proven extremely useful. The statistical visualization package <a href="http://www.jmp.com/">JMP,</a> from <a href="http://www.sas.com/">SAS</a> enables you to visually explore large statistical databases, e.g., point of sale data, results of experiments, or click-stream histories. JMP can also seamlessly import libraries of DISTs from Excel, making it the ideal tool for visualizing the inputs and outputs of Probability Management models.<BR><BR>

For a limited time, XLSim users can purchase a Single-User License of JMP 8 at a discounted price of $1,195 - that's $300 off the regular price. This special offer is only valid until December 22, 2008 and requires the coupon code, XLSIM122208j. To order, call 877.594.6567. To learn more about JMP or to download a free trial, visit <a href="http://www.jmp.com/">www.jmp.com.</a>

<h3>Risk Visualization Seminar</h3>
It takes more than software to be effective at Probability Management. In the first quarter of 2009 I will be delivering a series of half day seminars on Visualizing Risk in cooperation with SAS. The seminars will include a discussion of the tools and practices of Probability Management. In particular I will discuss interactive simulation, the validation of stochastic inputs, and the presentation of probabilistic results to managers who are still suffering post traumatic stress syndrome from their college statistics course.<BR><BR>

The complimentary seminars, <i>Visualizing Risk: A New Light Bulb for Illuminating Uncertainty,</i> will be offered on February 5th in New York City, March 26th in Chicago, and April 23rd in San Francisco. Seats are limited, so I encourage you to register early at <a
href="http://www.jmp.com/about/events/seminars">www.jmp.com/about/events/seminars.</a> I hope to see you there.

<h3>Jumpstart Probability Management in Your Own Organization</h3>
We encourage you to visit <a
href="http://www.probabilitymanagement.org/">ProbabilityManagement.org</a> and download the interactive simulation models based on the DIST data type. If you like what you see, AnalyCorp is ready to assist your organization in jumpstarting its adoption of Probability Management through training, prototype development, and complete lifecycle implementation. To discuss the possibilities with me by phone, please email my colleague Ron Roth at <a href=mailto:r.roth@analycorp.com>r.roth@analycorp.com</a> to schedule a time. I look forward to talking with you.<BR><BR>
