			<p>A common excuse for not doing analysis is the lack of data. You don’t need as much as most people think. When you have no data then you must use expert opinion. But you are better off if you calibrate them first.</p>

			The mission of Navy Recruiting Command (NRC) is to provide the Navy supply chain with the raw materials (recruits) necessary to meet the manpower requirements of the Navy. The authors adapted an existing Navy recruiting resource-allocation model by incorporating the techniques of probability management.The model incorporates the parameters of an econometric enlistment supply model to forecast the production of new contracts, accessions, total budget and changes in the Delayed Entry Program stock.<br> <br>

			Budgeting and forecasting is fraught with uncertainty and risk. Nowhere is this truer than in local governments where: demand tends to be counter-cyclical while revenues are pro-cyclical; it is not easy to go back on spending promises; and tax increases are a political non-starter.
			ProbabilityManagement.org has worked with local governments to develop a unique approach to forecasting and budgeting that exposes the risks decision-makers face in a way that deterministic methods never could, thereby allowing them to make resilient budgets and financial plans. <br> <br>

			Many SIPmath applications are about the “arithmetic of uncertainty” and are not much more than a Monte Carlo simulation. However, SIPmath can assess the Value of Information (with either perfect or imperfect information), and the appropriate decision policy. We will demonstrate how SIPmath can be used to compare the value of information from two types of “sneak previews” of a movie before spending money to release it to theaters nationwide. One sneak preview is conducted in the studio’s “Back Lot” (low cost & poor information) and the other gathers information from “10 Theaters” (higher cost and better information). We will also show with SIPmath that Value of Information is a distribution and not a single value.<br> <br>

			<a href="library/DC conf presentations/GregoryParnell_Integrated Approach PM Conference.pdf" target="_blank">Using Probability Management for Systems Engineering Trade-Off Analyses</a><br>
			Decision management is a critical systems engineering process during the systems life cycle. Making good decisions can increase the system value and reduce the system risk. To make good decisions, systems engineers and engineering managers need to create, explore, and analyze the system tradespace. Trade-off analyses play a critical role in providing the information required for systems design decision making. System life cycle involves many uncertainties about the environment, the adversary (competition or threat), and the use cases (scenarios). Surprisingly many of these studies do not consider uncertainty. We report on our book project Using Trade-off Analysis to Identify Value and Risk to incorporate uncertainty using probability management concepts.<br> <br>

			<a href="library/DC conf presentations/DavidCawlfield_Optimum Schedules Talk 4.zip" target="_blank">The Flaw of Averages in Optimization S&amp;OP</a><br>
			Nearly all Sales and Operations Planning uses LP Optimization; but uncertainty, especially in sales forecasts, commonly creates an opportunity for the Flaw of Averages to ruin the best laid plans. Using two-stage optimization, we first show that the best production plans are often very different from what conventional optimization would predict. Secondly, the author describes a scalable optimization approach using simulation optimization where recourse decisions are calculated for each trial. The results of some trial problems demonstrate that the current lean-manufacturing approach might be sub-optimal for many businesses, with large potential advantages to early adopters of this new approach.<br> <br>
