         <p>Simulations have been used for decades to manage uncertainty within standalone applications in areas as diverse as finance, engineering and energy. The open SIPmath™ Standard, developed by Palo Alto-based ProbabilityManagement.org, allows companies to link the results of their simulations across platforms using new data structures and free software tools.<br><br>
		 “SIPmath can be a breakthrough in the way we think about and analyze uncertainty,” said Brian Putt, Decision Analyst at Chevron, one of the nonprofit’s corporate sponsors, which also include several other Fortune 500 Companies.</p>
