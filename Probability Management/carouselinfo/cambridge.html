<p style="font-family:arial"><i>"The discipline of Probability Management transforms proven risk modeling techniques into simple business steps. 
<br><br>
Its open standard advances the field by representing uncertainties as unambiguous data, which may be shared across platforms. This allows bare spreadsheets and other applications to sum uncertainty across the enterprise while providing an audit trail."</i>

<p style="font-family:arial">The open SIPmath&trade; standard represents an uncertainty as an array of possible outcomes known as a Stochastic Information Packet or SIP. Calculating with SIPs is referred to as SIPmath. SIPmath is: 
<br><br>
<b>Actionable</b> - Uncertainties are calculated interactively just as numbers are in spreadsheets <br>
<b>Additive</b> - Uncertainties may be aggregated across platforms across the enterprise <br>
<b>Auditable</b> - Uncertainties are represented as unambiguous data with provenance <br></p>
